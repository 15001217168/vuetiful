# Vuetiful

Vuetiful is a component framework written on top of the Vue reactive library. It is primarily designed for creating business/administration applications where the displaying of data is paramount. Although targeted primarily at business applications, Vuetiful is extremely flexible and easily themed making it trivial to integrate into any website.

## Getting started
This project is still very much in the early days of development so it is not currently available on npm (but will be soon). 

To use the components simply download the `components.bundle.js` and `app.style.css` files from the `/dist` directory and link to them in your html.

Alternatively, if you would like to see a demo of the current set of components and styles you can clone this repo and build it to see a demo application. After cloning the repo run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

A browser window will automatically open and load the demo app.

## Remarks
As this project is in the early stages of development, documentation is limited. I will try to get documentation on use of the library up as soon as possible. A readme explaining usage will be available in the folder of each component. Thanks and happy coding!
